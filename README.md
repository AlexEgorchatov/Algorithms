# Algorithms

## Introduction

This project visualizes how different algorithms work. The motivation came from a desire to learn a front-end framework. After a year of work, version 1.0.0 of my first front-end project was released.

## Project Status

The project is in active development. There are many ongoing plans:
1) Description pane with a detailed explanation of an algorithm's work.
2) Line-by-line algorithm execution feature to highlight processes described in the Description.
3) Many more algorithms! (Aho–Corasick, Manacher’s Algorithm, Rabin-Karp, etc.)

## Acknowledgments

Many ideas and features were adopted from the related project VisuAlgo:
