# Algorithms

## Introduction

This project visualizes how different algorithms work. The motivation came from a desire to learn a front-end framework. After a year of work, version 1.0.0 of my first front-end project was released.

## Project Status

This project has successfully fulfilled its purpose of helping me grasp the concepts of ReactJS and TypeScript web development.  
It is no longer under active development, and no new features are planned.  
However, the existing visualizations remain available for reference and learning.

## Acknowledgments

Many ideas and features were adopted from the related project VisuAlgo:
